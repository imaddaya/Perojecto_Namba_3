                <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI, 
                    is like a smart friend that helps us in many ways. 
                    It predicts the weather, helps us learn new things, 
                    and even assists doctors in hospitals. 
                    With AI, we can solve big problems, 
                    learn faster, and stay healthy.
                    It's like having a super helper by our side!

                    While Artificial Intelligence, or AI,
                    can be helpful, it also has downsides,
                    especially for kids. Some worry that too much screen time with AI
                    devices might make it harder for kids to play outside 
                    or talk to real friends. It's important for kids 
                    to balance their time with AI and other activities 
                    for a healthy lifestyle.

                <h4>Positively</h4>

                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) streamlines tasks,
                    boosts productivity, and improves decision-making
                    in businesses. It enhances healthcare with early disease
                    detection and personalized treatments. 
                    AI innovations simplify daily routines,
                    offering adults more leisure time.
                </p>

                <h4>Negatively</h4>

                <p>
                    AI may lead to job displacement,
                    perpetuate biases, and pose privacy 
                    risks. Overdependence on AI can diminish critical
                    thinking skills and autonomy among adults. 
                    Addressing these concerns is crucial for a 
                    balanced integration of AI into society.

                <h4>Positively</h4>

                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) simplifies tasks,
                    enhances productivity, and aids decision-making 
                    for businesses. It improves healthcare with early
                    disease detection and tailored treatments.
                    AI innovations streamline daily tasks, providing
                    more leisure time for older individuals.

                <h4>Negatively</h4>

                <p>
                    AI may contribute to job displacement,
                    perpetuate biases, and pose privacy risks
                    for older individuals. Overreliance on AI
                    can weaken critical thinking skills and independence
                    among the elderly. Addressing these concerns is 
                    vital for a balanced integration of AI into society for 
                    older adults.
